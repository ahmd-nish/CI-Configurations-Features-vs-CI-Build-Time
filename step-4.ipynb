    "## How the “Step 4” Threaded Script Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configuration**  \n",
    "   - Defines file paths (`projects_ci.csv`, `ci_configs/`, `build_runs.csv`), a log file, request timeouts, sleep interval between requests (`0.5 s`), thread pool size (`MAX_WORKERS=5`), and a list of five GitHub tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`process_repo(idx, row)`**  \n",
    "   - **Token rotation**: selects `TOKENS[idx % len(TOKENS)]` so each thread uses a different PAT in round-robin.  \n",
    "   - **Download workflows**: GETs `.github/workflows` contents, saves each `.yml`/`.yaml` into `ci_configs/owner--repo/`.  \n",
    "   - **Fetch latest run**: queries `/actions/runs?per_page=1` on the default branch; if found, retrieves job list to count jobs, collect runner names, and compute duration in minutes.  \n",
    "   - **Return value**: a dict with extended fields (`run_id`, `run_number`, `workflow_name`, `event`, `head_sha`, `status`, `created_at`, `duration_min`, etc.), or `None` if no runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`main()` Orchestration**  \n",
    "   - Reads `projects_ci.csv` into a DataFrame and writes the header row to `build_runs.csv`.  \n",
    "   - Ensures the `ci_configs/` directory exists.  \n",
    "   - Spawns a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with 5 workers, submitting one `process_repo` task per row.  \n",
    "   - As each future completes, under a thread-safe lock it appends non-`None` records to `build_runs.csv`.  \n",
    "   - Logs progress every 100 repos and records all successes and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Smart Rate-Limit Workaround\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Tokens**: rotates across five PATs (`TOKENS[idx % 5]`) to multiply available quota.  \n",
    "- **Throttling**: adds a small `time.sleep(0.5)` after each API call to avoid bursts.  \n",
    "- **Moderate Concurrency**: uses only 5 threads to balance speed and rate-limit safety.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these measures prevent 403s from GitHub’s secondary rate-limit/abuse detection while still leveraging parallelism for efficiency.  "
